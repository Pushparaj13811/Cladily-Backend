# HTTP Status Codes Documentation

## Overview

The `httpStatusCodes.js` module defines standard HTTP status codes used for API responses. This file provides a set of constants representing various HTTP status codes, categorized by their meanings. Using these constants in your code improves readability and ensures consistency across your application.

## Categories

The status codes are categorized into the following groups:

### 1xx: Informational

- **`HTTP_CONTINUE`** (100): Indicates that the initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server.
- **`HTTP_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS`** (101): Indicates that the server is willing to change the protocol used for the request.

### 2xx: Success

- **`HTTP_OK`** (200): Indicates that the request was successful and the server responded with the requested data.
- **`HTTP_CREATED`** (201): Indicates that the request was successful and a new resource was created.
- **`HTTP_ACCEPTED`** (202): Indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete.
- **`HTTP_NO_CONTENT`** (204): Indicates that the request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response.

### 3xx: Redirection

- **`HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY`** (301): Indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URI.
- **`HTTP_FOUND`** (302): Indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URI.
- **`HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED`** (304): Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the last request.

### 4xx: Client Errors

- **`HTTP_BAD_REQUEST`** (400): Indicates that the server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **`HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED`** (401): Indicates that authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.
- **`HTTP_FORBIDDEN`** (403): Indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **`HTTP_NOT_FOUND`** (404): Indicates that the requested resource could not be found.
- **`HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`** (405): Indicates that the method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource.
- **`HTTP_CONFLICT`** (409): Indicates that the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.
- **`HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY`** (422): Indicates that the server understands the content type of the request entity, but was unable to process the contained instructions.

### 5xx: Server Errors

- **`HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`** (500): Indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **`HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`** (501): Indicates that the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- **`HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY`** (502): Indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **`HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`** (503): Indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.
- **`HTTP_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT`** (504): Indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

## Usage

Import the status codes into your application modules to use them for HTTP responses:

```javascript
import {
  HTTP_OK,
  HTTP_CREATED,
  HTTP_NOT_FOUND,
  HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
} from './httpStatusCodes.js';

// Example usage in an Express.js route handler
app.get('/api/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.status(HTTP_OK).json({ message: 'Resource fetched successfully.' });
});
```

## Export

The file exports all the defined status codes in a single export statement, making them available for import in other modules:

```javascript
export {
  HTTP_CONTINUE,
  HTTP_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS,
  HTTP_OK,
  HTTP_CREATED,
  HTTP_ACCEPTED,
  HTTP_NO_CONTENT,
  HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY,
  HTTP_FOUND,
  HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED,
  HTTP_BAD_REQUEST,
  HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED,
  HTTP_FORBIDDEN,
  HTTP_NOT_FOUND,
  HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED,
  HTTP_CONFLICT,
  HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
  HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
  HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED,
  HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY,
  HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE,
  HTTP_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT
};
```

## Notes

- Ensure to use the appropriate status code for each response to accurately represent the outcome of API requests.
- Consistent use of these codes across our application will help maintain clarity and uniformity in API responses.
- It is mandatory to use this format only.
